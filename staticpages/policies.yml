        ## Grade

        Your grade is composed of the following components:

        Percentage | Component
        ---------- | ------------------
        5%         | Online quizzes
        20%        | Homework
        50%        | Examlets (equal weight)
        25%        | Final

        ### Grading Scale

        All your grade components will be added up with the percentage
        weights indicated and result in a single number. This number will
        determine your letter grade, according to the following scales:

        Grade  | Point Range
        ------ |------------
        A+     | [97, 100)
        A      | [93, 97)
        A-     | [90, 93)
        B+     | [87, 90)
        B      | [83, 87)
        B-     | [80, 83)
        C+     | [77, 80)
        C      | [73, 77)
        C-     | [70, 73)
        D+     | [67, 70)
        D      | [63, 67)
        D-     | [60, 63)

        ### General Rules

        *   After grades are released for any homework set, quiz, or examlet, you
            have two weeks in order to clarify any misgivings you may have about
            the grade you received. Once two weeks have passed, the assigned
            grade is considered accepted and no further complaints will be
            considered.

        ## Registration

        CS 357 is, unfortunately, too popular for its own good, leading to
        annoyances like waitlists and sections with controlled access.

        Some of you have asked to take part in class activities despite
        not being *officially* registered for the class, and we are usually happy
        to make this possible. If you choose to make use of this, you will
        be held to the same standard as every other student that is officially
        registered for the class, and, at the discretion of the instructor,
        work you do as part of this 'unofficial' participation *may* be eligible
        for class credit if you later become officially registered.

        However, please keep the following two things in mind:

        1. While it is quite likely that spots will open up as the semester
           continues, we are unable to promise that this will happen.

        2. As long as you are not officially signed up (check with the academic
           office in 1210 Siebel if you're not sure), you will not receive
           university credit for the work you are doing.

        In particular being "enrolled" in the course on this site has
        no administrative significance to the university. What matters is
        enrollment as shown in the [UIUC self-service
        application](https://apps.uillinois.edu/selfservice/).

    id: quizzes
    content: |

        ## Online quizzes

        There will be a small amount of pre-class material along with a short
        quiz before each class.  All these quizzes (also the one on grading
        policies!) contribute a small amount to your grade.

        These rules apply to the quizzes, unless otherwise stated:

        *   Pre-lecture material and associated quizzes will be posted 24 hours before
            the lecture at the latest. You will find links to this material on the
            class calendar page in the section for the upcoming lecture.

        *   Quizzes will usually allow **three graded attempts**.

            Of these, the one with the higher grade will count.

        *   We obviously can't keep you from **looking up information** while you're taking the quiz.
            To an extent, that's fine. Nonetheless, try to do as much of the quiz as you can from
            memory. You'll learn more.

        *   Please *don't* take these quizzes **as a group**, or **speak with
            your peers** about the answers.

        *   Each quiz has a **deadline**. Usually, that deadline will be the
            beginning of the next class.
            After that deadline has passed, you can still take the quiz for
            **half-credit for three days**. Once that period has passed, you will
            still be able to review your answers and the correct answer, but
            you will not be allowed to take the quiz again for credit.
            (You may repeat the quiz to practice, however.)

        *   There is no time limit on these quizzes other than the deadline.
            (I.e. if it takes you a day to complete the quiz, that's fine,
            as long as you click "End Session" and "Confirm" before the deadline.)

            If you do not submit your quiz before the deadline, it will
            automatically roll over to half-credit.

            After the half-credit deadline expires, you will lose the ability to
            make changes to your quiz. The current state of the quiz at
            that point will count as your submitted answer (for half credit).

        *   **IMPORTANT:** You must fully submit your entire quiz in order to
            receive credit.  To do so, you must press the "Submit Assignment"
            button in the upper right corner.  **This is separate from
            submitting a final answer to a single question.** Failure to submit
            the entire quiz, regardless of whether answers were saved for
            individual questions, will result in no credit.

        <div class="alert alert-info">
        If you're thinking of violating these rules, consider the following:
        The grade contribution of the quizzes is small enough
        and there are enough quizzes that messing up (even badly!) on a few
        will not have a measurable effect on your grade.
        </div>

    content: |

        ## Homework

        Homework sets will be due every week except for examlet weeks.
        These will be generally be long-form and require some coding as well
        as theory work. The due dates are shown on the start page of each
        homework set and in the [class calendar](calendar:).

        <div class="alert alert-success">
        The grading policy is set up so that you can mess up on the
        homework quite badly without a drastic impact on your grade. The homework
        is *intended* as a learning experience, so making mistakes is OK.
        </div>

        ### Late homework

        *   Homework submitted after the deadline will count for half of its
            original worth. This offer is good for up to one week after the
            original deadline. After that, no late work will be accepted.

        *   Solutions to the homework sets will be posted after the due date.
            If you are submitting homework for the half-credit due date,
            feel free to use the posted solutions in writing up your own
            solution. You may however *not* directly copy the sample solution.
            What you submit must still be written by you, not just copied.

        ### Grading

        You get exactly one submission per homework set. In particular, this
        means that:

        *   After you click "Submit Assignment" in the top right corner, you will
            not be able to make changes to your work.

        *   Unlike quizzes, homework sets expire automatically at (or soon after)
            the deadline. If you would like to make use of the half-credit
            opportunity, you **must** select "At deadline: Do not submit session
            for grading". Otherwise, the homework set will automatically be submitted
            at the deadline. This is particularly true if you have not worked on
            the homework set at all but wish to work on it during the half-credit
            period.

        *   We **do not accept partial submissions** on the homework.  (e.g. we
            won't let you submit problem 1 and 2 before and 3, 4, 5 after the
            deadline.) There will also be **no resubmissions** of work already
            graded. If, between the posted solution and your graded work, you
            still have questions, feel free to raise those on Piazza or during
            the TA's office hours.

        ### Collaboration on Homework

        *   You may *discuss* your approach (but not your code or your writeups)
            with your peers. All parts of each homework set must be your own work.
            You must have typed/written every part of your homework
            yourself. In some cases, code/pieces of work from elsewhere *may* be
            allowed--if so, this will be stated in the instructions. In that
            case, you *must* acknowledge the source.

        *   If we notice that your work has considerable overlap with someone else's
            (and we *do* check), the both of you should be ready to have an unpleasant
            conversation and face penalites as provided by campus rules regarding
            academic honesty.

        ## Examlets and Final Exam

        There will be an "examlet" every three weeks during the semester, along
        with a longer final exam. The examlets and the final will take place in
        a computer-based testing facility ("CBTF") in the basement of Grainger
        Library.  The examlets will be offered over a period of a few days.  You
        must schedule an two-hour-long block within that time span in which to
        take the examlet.  You must schedule your examlet using a self-service web
        site provided by the facility. Instructions will be given in the class
        calendar.

        All examlets and the final are cumulative.

        ### Taking Examlets

        *   You will take your examlets as scheduled with the CBTF, and only on
            the scheduled day and time. If you do not take the examlet (e.g. by not
            scheduling an appointment, by not reporting to the facility at the
            scheduled time, or by not performing the required work),
            the examlet will be counted as a zero.

        *   There will be no exceptions to the examlet scheduling policy except in
            cases of severe emergency (e.g., loss of life or limb). Examples of
            events that do not qualify as emergencies include (but are not limited
            to): transportation problems, conflict with work schedule, important
            family vacation, or computer problems. The policies of the facility
            apply during each examlet for aspects such as late arrival and emergency
            closures.

        *   For any type of foreseeable absence, documentation must be received
            by the instructor
            at least *one week* before the examlet to be acceptable, at which point
            the instructor will determine whether a make-up examlet will be allowed.

            Make-up examlets are not allowed without proper documentation as described
            above or for university-approved activities.  Make-up examlets are not
            allowed for any type of unexcused absences, including missing class to
            study for a test, oversleeping, not being ready to take the examlet, or
            having to work at an outside job.

            For health-related or other absence because of an emergency, the
            instructor must be notified at least two hours prior to the examlet
            to receive *consideration* for a make-up examlet, but preferably
            as early as possible. An hour before the examlet at the latest, the
            instructor will provide guidance on whether a make-up examlet will
            be allowed.

        *   **No aids** other than a writing utensil and paper provided by the facility are
            allowed in examlets. In particular: If you are seen *near* a phone, MP3 player or
            other digital device (turned on or not--it does not matter) during
            an examlet, you will receive a grade of **zero** for the examlet.

        *   Only examlets taken in accordance with these rules will receive
            credit. Any deviation from these rules will lead to the
            exam in question being assinged a grade of **zero**.

        ### Conflict examlets

        Since you will be allowed to take the examlets at the testing center over a period of
        a few days, conflict examlets will generally not be provided.

        ### Accommodations

        Please let us (<a href="mailto:solomon2@illinois.edu?subject=Exam accommodations"
          role="button" class="btn btn-default">Edgar &raquo;</a> or <a href="mailto:andreask@illinois.edu?subject=Examlet accommodations"
          role="button" class="btn btn-default">Andreas &raquo;</a> ) know as soon as you can if you need
        special accommodations (extra time etc.) on examlets. Thanks!

        ## Extra credit opportunities

        *   Ask and answer good questions on Piazza. Every numerics-related question
            that an instructor marks as a good question/answer is worth 0.1 points on
            your final course grade, up to a maximum of 1 point.

        *   Do very well on exams. 100% on an examlet is awarded even when you make
            a mistake on some questions. (See each examlet's rules/start page for details
            on how many.) If you get more questions right than the 100% standard,
            those points are yours to keep.

        ## Student responsibilities

        Please read and understand the
        [UIUC student code](http://studentcode.illinois.edu/Pocket_Code_web2013.pdf)
        (link opens PDF).

        In particular, make sure to read and understand Paragraph §1‑402. The rules there
        along with the rules in this tutorial form the foundation for making sure you
        and everyone else in the class receive a *fair*, *transparent* grade.
