        ## Grade

        Your grade is composed of the following components:

        Percentage | Component
        ---------- | ------------------
        40% (4x10%)        | Homework
        40% (2x20%)        | Exams
        20%                | Project
        5% (up to)        | Participation

        ### General Rules

        *   After grades are released for any homework set or exam you
            have two weeks in order to clarify any misgivings you may have about
            the grade you received. Once two weeks have passed, the assigned
            grade is considered accepted and no further complaints will be
            considered.
        *   The grade curve (if required) will be separate for 3-credit and 
            4-credit students, and will not include the participation grade 
            i.e.  it is possible to earn 105% grade.

        ## Additional Participation Credit (up to 5%)

        This may be earned by participating in lecture & online discussions, 
        scribing lectures (3-credit students only) and by reporting mistakes 
        in the lecture notes.

        ## Homework

        The homeworks will consist of a combination of machine problems and 
        written exercises to be submitted on the course relate website. 

        Submitted solutions to the machine problems must be written in Python, 
        using only standard libraries (numpy / scipy). We will sometimes block 
        libraries as required.

        Solutions to the written problems must be submitted as Latex typeset PDF’s. 
        Each question must begin on a new page. You may use WYSIWYG latex editors 
        such as LyX if you are unfamiliar with Latex.

        The due dates are shown on the start page of each homework set and in the 
        [class calendar](calendar:).

        ### Late policy

        You have 96 hours of "credit" that you can use any way you want. 
        You don't need to come to us and ask to submit the homework late. 
        Just submit it when you are ready; we will accumulate your late 
        time and allow up to 96 hours for the whole semester. 

        Late submission will not be accepted once homework solutions are 
        released online. Typically, we will wait for up to 96 hours after 
        due date before we release the solutions. However, when there is 
        an exam coming up, we may want to release solutions earlier. This 
        means that you may not be able to use all 96 hours of credit on 
        assignments that are due near exams. When we release these assignments, 
        we will inform you if late submission is not accepted. 

        <div class="alert alert-info">
        **IMPORTANT:** You must track your own late hours. We will provide a 
        cumulative account periodically and at the end of the semester.
        </div>

        Do let us know if there are extreme situations where this lenient 
        policy isn't satisfactory.


        ### Grading

        You get exactly one submission per homework set. In particular, this
        means that:

        *   After you click "Submit Assignment" in the top right corner, you will
            not be able to make changes to your work.

        *   Homework sets expire automatically at (or soon after)
            the deadline. If you would like to make use of your late hours,
            you **must** select "At deadline: Do not submit session
            for grading". Otherwise, the homework set will automatically be submitted
            at the deadline. 

        ### Academic integrity
        
        Feel free to discuss the assignment with each other in general terms, and to 
        search the Web for general guidance (not for complete solutions). All 
        solutions should be written up individually. If you make substantial use of 
        some information from outside sources, be sure to acknowledge the sources in 
        your solution. In particular, please acknowledge all other students you 
        worked with on the homework/projects.

        We will follow the departmental honor code policy here: 
        https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/honor-code

        <div class="alert alert-success">
        If we notice that your work has considerable overlap with someone else's
        (and we *do* check), the both of you should be ready to have an unpleasant
        conversation and face penalites as provided by campus rules regarding
        academic honesty.

        ## Exams

        There will be an "examlet" every three weeks during the semester, along
        with a longer final exam. The examlets and the final will take place in
        a computer-based testing facility ("CBTF") in the basement of Grainger
        Library.  The examlets will be offered over a period of a few days.  You
        must schedule an two-hour-long block within that time span in which to
        take the examlet.  You must schedule your examlet using a self-service web
        site provided by the facility. Instructions will be given in the class
        calendar.

        All examlets and the final are cumulative.

        ### Taking Examlets

        *   You will take your examlets as scheduled with the CBTF, and only on
            the scheduled day and time. If you do not take the examlet (e.g. by not
            scheduling an appointment, by not reporting to the facility at the
            scheduled time, or by not performing the required work),
            the examlet will be counted as a zero.

        *   There will be no exceptions to the examlet scheduling policy except in
            cases of severe emergency (e.g., loss of life or limb). Examples of
            events that do not qualify as emergencies include (but are not limited
            to): transportation problems, conflict with work schedule, important
            family vacation, or computer problems. The policies of the facility
            apply during each examlet for aspects such as late arrival and emergency
            closures.

        *   For any type of foreseeable absence, documentation must be received
            by the instructor
            at least *one week* before the examlet to be acceptable, at which point
            the instructor will determine whether a make-up examlet will be allowed.

            Make-up examlets are not allowed without proper documentation as described
            above or for university-approved activities.  Make-up examlets are not
            allowed for any type of unexcused absences, including missing class to
            study for a test, oversleeping, not being ready to take the examlet, or
            having to work at an outside job.

            For health-related or other absence because of an emergency, the
            instructor must be notified at least two hours prior to the examlet
            to receive *consideration* for a make-up examlet, but preferably
            as early as possible. An hour before the examlet at the latest, the
            instructor will provide guidance on whether a make-up examlet will
            be allowed.

        *   **No aids** other than a writing utensil and paper provided by the facility are
            allowed in examlets. In particular: If you are seen *near* a phone, MP3 player or
            other digital device (turned on or not--it does not matter) during
            an examlet, you will receive a grade of **zero** for the examlet.

        *   Only examlets taken in accordance with these rules will receive
            credit. Any deviation from these rules will lead to the
            exam in question being assinged a grade of **zero**.

        ### Conflict examlets

        Since you will be allowed to take the examlets at the testing center over a period of
        a few days, conflict examlets will generally not be provided.

        ### Accommodations

        Please let us (<a href="mailto:solomon2@illinois.edu?subject=Exam accommodations"
          role="button" class="btn btn-default">Edgar &raquo;</a> or <a href="mailto:andreask@illinois.edu?subject=Examlet accommodations"
          role="button" class="btn btn-default">Andreas &raquo;</a> ) know as soon as you can if you need
        special accommodations (extra time etc.) on examlets. Thanks!

        ## Extra credit opportunities

        *   Ask and answer good questions on Piazza. Every numerics-related question
            that an instructor marks as a good question/answer is worth 0.1 points on
            your final course grade, up to a maximum of 1 point.

        *   Do very well on exams. 100% on an examlet is awarded even when you make
            a mistake on some questions. (See each examlet's rules/start page for details
            on how many.) If you get more questions right than the 100% standard,
            those points are yours to keep.
