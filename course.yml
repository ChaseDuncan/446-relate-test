            ## Course Description
            
            The goal of Machine Learning is to build computer systems that can adapt and learn from their experience. 
            This course will study the theory and application of learning methods that have proved valuable and 
            successful in practical applications. We review the theory of machine learning in order to get a good 
            understanding of the basic issues in this area, and present the main paradigms and techniques needed to 
            obtain successful performance in application areas such as natural language and text understanding, 
            speech recognition, computer vision, data mining, adaptive computer systems and others. The main body 
            of the course will review several supervised and (semi/un)supervised learning approaches. These include 
            methods for learning linear representations, Bayesian / Probabilistic methods, decision-tree methods, 
            kernel based methods and neural networks, as well as clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques. 
            We will also discuss how to model machine learning problems and discuss some open problems.

            ### Topics to be covered include:
            
            * Linear/Logistic Regression
            * Variable Selection / Sparsity 
            * Optimization - Gradient Descent
            * Support Vector Machines
            * Convolutional/Recurrent Neural Networks
            * Clustering
            * Graphical Models
            * Expectation Maximization
            * Variational Inference
            * Generative Adversarial Networks
            * Multilabel Classification
            * Structured Prediction

            ## Computing

            We will be using [Python](http://python.org) with the libraries
            [numpy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/),
            [scipy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) and
            [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) for
            assignments. No other languages are permitted. Python has a very
            gentle learning curve, so you should feel at home even if you've
            never done any work in Python.
