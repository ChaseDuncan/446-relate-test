            **CAUTION!**

            These scribbled PDFs are an *unedited* reflection of what we wrote during class.
            They need to be viewed in the context of the class discussion that led to them.
            See the lecture videos for that.

            If you would like actual, self-contained class notes, look in the outline above.

            These scribbles are provided here to provide a record of our class discussion,
            to be used in perhaps the following ways:

            * as a way to cross-check your own notes
            * to look up a formula that you know was shown in a certain class
            * to remind yourself of what exactly was covered on a given day

            By continuing to read them, you acknowledge that these files are provided
            as supplementary material on an as-is basis.

            ## Computing

            We will be using [Python](http://python.org) with the libraries
            [numpy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/),
            [scipy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) and
            [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) for in-class work and
            assignments. No other languages are permitted. Python has a very
            gentle learning curve, so you should feel at home even if you've
            never done any work in Python.

            ### Virtual Machine Image

            While you are free to install Python and Numpy on your own computer
            to do homework, the only *supported* way to do so is using the
            supplied virtual machine image.
